/** Implements a generalized traversal of a graph.  At any given time,
 *  there is a particular set of untraversed vertices---the "fringe."
 *  Traversal consists of repeatedly removing an untraversed vertex
 *  from the fringe, visting it, and then adding its untraversed
 *  successors to the fringe.  The client can dictate an ordering on
 *  the fringe, determining which item is next removed, by which kind
 *  of traversal is requested.
 *     + A depth-first traversal treats the fringe as a list, and adds
 *       and removes vertices at one end.  It also revisits the node
 *       itself after traversing all successors by calling the
 *       postVisit method on it.
 *     + A breadth-first traversal treats the fringe as a list, and adds
 *       and removes vertices at different ends.  It also revisits the node
 *       itself after traversing all successors as for depth-first
 *       traversals.
 *     + A general traversal treats the fringe as an ordered set, as
 *       determined by a Comparator argument.  There is no postVisit
 *       for this type of traversal.
 *  As vertices are added to the fringe, the traversal calls a
 *  preVisit method on the vertex.
 *
 *  Generally, the client will extend Traversal, overriding the visit,
 *  preVisit, and postVisit methods, as desired (by default, they do nothing).
 *  Any of these methods may throw StopException to halt the traversal
 *  (temporarily, if desired).  The preVisit method may throw a
 *  RejectException to prevent a vertex from being added to the
 *  fringe, and the visit method may throw a RejectException to
 *  prevent its successors from being added to the fringe.
