# This a Makefile, an input file for the 'make' program.  For you 
# command-line and Emacs enthusiasts, this makes it possible to build
# this program with a single command:
#     gmake 
# (or just 'make' if you are on a system that uses GNU make by default,
# such as Linux.) You can also clean up junk files and .class files with
#     gmake clean
# To run style61b (our style enforcer) over your source files, type
#     gmake style
# Finally, you can run tests with
#     gmake check

# This is not an especially efficient Makefile, because it's not easy to
# figure out the minimal set of Java files that need to be recompiled.  
# So if any .class file does not exist or is older than its .java file,
# we just remove all the .class files, compile the main class, and 
# then compile everything in the plugin directory.  

# All source files
