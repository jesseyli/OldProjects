   The following  quotation about writing  test programs for  a document
compiler from an article by Donald Knuth conveys some of the right frame
of mind[1]:
    "... I generally get best results by writing a test program that
    no sane user would ever  think of writing.... The resulting test
    program is so crazy that I could not possibly explain to anybody
    else what it is supposed to do...."
You should also  read Column 3 of _More Programming  Pearls_[2] for more
advice. Among other things, this column discusses scaffolding.

    The standard C header file  assert.h provides a macro "assert". When
this file is included in a source file, and the file is compiled without
the  option  -DNDEBUG, each  call  assert(C),  where  C is  any  boolean
expression, will terminate the program with  an error message if C turns
out to be false at that point.
